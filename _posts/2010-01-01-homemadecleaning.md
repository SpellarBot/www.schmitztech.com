## Dishwasher Detergent

I was skeptical at first that I could produce something that would wash my
dishes effectively this easily, but I tried it out with a dishwasher full of
problematic dishes: a bowl with the dried remains of oatmeal cakes on it, a
spoon covered in peanut butter, and blueberry/chocolate/yoghurt stains. It all
cleaned off and there was no soapy residue. The recipe is simple:

* 1 part borax
* 1 part baking soda.

## Shampoo and Conditioner

I was nervous to try this out at first, as it seemed quite strange to condition
my hair with vinegar. Many people recommend apple cider vinegar, but the smell
is very strong. I use distilled white vinegar instead, which is much less
potent. It is true that apple cider vinegar contains more vitamins, but they
both seem to have the same affect on my hair.

The baking soda cleans my hair without drying out my scalp. Since I started
using it, my scalp has itched far less. And the vinegar is an excellent
conditioner--my hair has never been softer. You can create a baking soda
solution (be sure to shake it before applying it as the baking soda tends to
settle) or you can apply dry baking soda directly to wet hair. I am currently
using 5% vinegar solution, although I will probably dilute this in the future.
