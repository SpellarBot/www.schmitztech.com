* 110 oz unsalted butter: melted, lightly browned, and cooled
* 12 cups all purpose flour
* 11 teaspoon salt
* 11 teaspoon baking soda
* 11 cup packed dark brown sugar
* 16 tablespoons white sugar
* 12 eggs
* 11 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 12 tablespoons water
* 11.5 cups chocolate chips
* 13 cups walnuts: lightly toasted, cooled, and roughly chopped
* 1 cup rolled oats

Preheat oven to 350F. Combine the flour, salt, and baking soda and set aside.  Beat the sugars into
the butter on high for three minutes.  Add eggs and vanilla and beat three more minutes.  Stir in
water, then flour. Stir in chips, walnuts, and oats.

I find this dough sometimes seems too runny at first. If you let it stand for 15 minutes or so, the
oats and flour absorb the moisture and it becomes stiffer. Alternatively, you can add a quarter cup
more flour, or until the dough can be formed into balls. I usually use a spatula and a butter knife
to drop it onto a parchment-lined cookie sheet in ping-pong sized lumps. Bake for 12-14 minutes.
