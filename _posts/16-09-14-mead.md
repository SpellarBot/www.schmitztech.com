We picked many bushels of Bartlett pears off of Paul and Sara's pear tree.  We
juiced them, and ended up with so much juice Lia made a melomel.

## 2016 Pear Melomel

* 5 gallons of pear juice
* 8 lb honey (the planned range was 7-16 lb honey to reach SG 1.1)
* 2 tsp pectic enzyme
* 6 camden tablets (total volume was 5.5 gallons)
* 1 tsp yeast nutrient
* 1 package Cote de Blanc (pitched directly)
