# Dyeing Shirts Naturally

![Shirts]({{ baseurl }}/assets/img/shirts.jpg)

I wanted to naturally dye some shirts with walnut dye.  First, I soaked black
walnut husks for some months and poured off the black liquid.  Next I
experimented with 4 shirts.

I soaked all the shirts in 2 tablespoons of alum and cream of tartar overnight.
For shirts 3 and 4 I simmered them in another 1 tablespoon of alum and cream of
tartar the next day.

1.  I simmered shirt 1 in the walnut dye for a couple of hours and then
    simmered it in a pot with 1 tablespoon of iron modifier.  The shirt
    immediately turned quite gray.

2.  For shirts 2 and 3 I simmered them in walnut dye for a couple of hours.  I
    expected shirt 3 to have a deeper color, but they both ended up with a
    light brown.  I would have liked to have a richer brown.

3.  See above.

4.  I simmered shirt 4 in turmeric water.  I mixed in around 3 oz of turmeric
    into a few gallons of water.  The shirt turned into a beautiful turmeric
    yellow.
