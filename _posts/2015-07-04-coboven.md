We stoked the cob oven from 8 to 12:30 and then cooked:

* 11 pizzas, starting 800 degrees and ending near 500 degrees
* 3 loaves of bread
* 2 dutch ovens of cinammon rolls
* Ribs, a pot of beans, and potatos

The bread browned quickly, but baked excellently.  The ribs cooked well, but we
could have left them in for another hours (they were only in the oven for
around 2 hours.

The beans and potatos were underdone.  The beans didn't cook well because I had
added tomato.  The potatos did not get hot enough--next time I would put them
in at bread temperature.  I put the potatos back in the oven overnight.  In the
morning they were hot to the touch but still not always fully cooked.  Potatos
need it hot!

I also learned that the potatos need to be removed from the foil immediately
after being taken out of the oven.  Otherwise they get soggy.  I'd like to try
cooking them in the oven without foil.

We stoked the cob oven for 3 1/2 hours and then cooked:

* 8 pizzas with 8 ears of corn on the sides
* Roasted some garlic and cooked root vegetables
* 2 loaves of bread
* Cinammon rolls
* Pulled pork and beans

Everything cooked excellently.  The corn can go in immediately after the fire
is removed.
