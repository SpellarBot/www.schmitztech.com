We stoked the cob oven for 3 1/2 hours and then cooked:

* 8 pizzas with 8 ears of corn on the sides
* Roasted some garlic and cooked root vegetables
* 2 loaves of bread
* Cinammon rolls
* Pulled pork and beans

Everything cooked excellently.  The corn can go in immediately after the fire
is removed.
