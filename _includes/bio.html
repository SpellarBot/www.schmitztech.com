I am 27 years old and a graduate from the University of Washington in the
Department of Computer Science and the Department of Mathematics. I have a
strong interest in logic and programming languages, and now I am working in the
field of Artificial Intelligence, specifically NLP.

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking in the Cascades, kayaking through the San
Juans, baking bread in my cob oven, cidermaking in the fall, and living
the island life on Whidbey Island.
