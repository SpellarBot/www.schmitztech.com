### Employment

**Teaching Assistant and Coordinator**  
University of Washington
*September 2005 - December 2006*  
Instructed part of a 5-credit computer science course that covers basic data

**Research Assistant**  
University of Washington  
*April 2007 - December 2007*  
Developed the PanImages tool to translate words into languages with indirect
dictionary connections (i.e. Bengali into Basque where no direct dictionary is
available) and group the translations by the different senses of the source
word (i.e. distinguish translations of the season spring from translations of
"flexible coil"). This work is visible on a frontend that connects these
translations to google images, providing a panlingual image search. Check it
out: http://www.panimages.org/.
