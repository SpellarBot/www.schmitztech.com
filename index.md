### About

I am a graduate from the [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu/)
in the [Department of Computer Science](http://cs.washington.edu/) and the
[Department of Mathematics](http://math.washington.edu/).  I'm currently a
Director of Engineering at the [Allen Institute for AI](http://www.allenai.org).

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking in the Cascades, kayaking through the San
Juans, baking bread in my cob oven, cidermaking in the fall, and living the
island life on Whidbey Island.
